About
Teamo (Esperanto: team) is about better governance model (reflexive method) for public/private sector and consortia.
Teamo idea starts with the urgent need for a better governance model that scale bottom up (reflexive method) to create a more effective chain of command to leverage the intrinsic value that stakeholders could bring to the table by improving return on investment and reducing market risk for all stakeholders involved.

Our goal is to attack the governance trilemma (social, capital and technological) for helping start-up, public/private sector and consortia to have better governance model. We open a collective because we know that reflexivity is contextual, is no one size that fit them all about governance, on the same token we could build a strong foundation based on collaboration, transparency, and honesty.

Governance is about values, at Teamo our value is creating richness and our core value is about sharing the pursuit of happiness, we strongly believe that the road of prosperity should be shared, cared and maintained with network rule that favor cooperation over competition.
